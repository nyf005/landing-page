            Supporting African businesses in their journey to excellence.

          </h1>
          <p>
            The world thrives on systemic scientific discoveries without which
            advancement and problem resolution would be near impossible.
            Needless to say, research is a big part of it. Unfortunately, many
            African research entities and laboratories, if not all, go largely
            under-funded and riddled with massive impediments. Additionally,
            there often is a lack of technical equipment and monetary incentives
            for mentors. This list can go on. At Tungsten Global Consulting, we
            recognize the urgency and thrive on crafting unique solutions to
            each problem. Our goal is to offer viable results through strategic
            partnerships by deploying the right leaders and tools in the field.
